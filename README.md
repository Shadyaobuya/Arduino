Question 2:
1. Elevators commonly use servo motors to safely and smoothly move passengers in some tall buildings. 
2. Printers: Servo motors stop and start the print heads precisely on the page as well as move paper along to print multiple rows of text or graphics in exact lines, whether it's a newspaper, a magazine, or an annual report.
3. Automobiles also use servo motors. In modern cars, servo motors are used to control its speed. When stepping on the gas pedal, it sends electrical signals to the carâ€™s computer. The computer then processes that information and sends a signal to the servo attached to the throttle to adjust the engine speed.
