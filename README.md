Question 1: [link to my Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/cTIa9iM52zC-neat-migelo/editel)

Question 2:
1. Elevators- commonly use servo motors to safely and smoothly move passengers in some tall buildings. 
2. Printers- Servo motors stop and start the print heads precisely on the page as well as move paper along to print multiple rows of text or graphics in exact lines.
3. Automobiles- also use servo motorsto control its speed. When stepping on the gas pedal, it sends electrical signals to the carâ€™s computer which then sends a signal to the servo attached to the throttle to adjust the engine speed.
